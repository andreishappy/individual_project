Things to do:

       - check if tuple insert works on CORE on my project machine
       - research Threading in Python

       - write a script which picks up the output of the engine,
         writes it to log and also pulls it in as native python
	 types
       - wrap that script in an object with methods:
       	      - start_engine(string instance) which returns a handle on the output
	        of an engine and the engine itself
              - stop_engine(string instance) kills a specific instance
	      - stop_engines() kills all engines
	      - tuple_insert(string instance, string table)
	      - tuple_read(string instance, string table)
	      
	      After dsmdir is fixed
	      - display_engines() show all the engines that are on
	      	in a user-friendly way
